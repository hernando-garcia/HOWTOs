Pre-reqs
--------

Since https://github.com needs to be able to access the Jenkins Master, which in my case runs on my laptop, behind a public address (the one my ISP assigned via DHCP to my home router) and NATed (done at the home router so nothing I need to do here) to a private one (home network)  

1) My home router (My ISP is BT btw) must be able to allow https://github.com access (via port forwarding - home router) to port 8080 on the public IP that redirects the connection to my laptop on my private network on the same port.

Steps
-----

Create the webhook in the Github's repository you want Jenkins to run automatically upon a push (defult) is executed as follow:

* https://github.com/hernando-garcia/jenkins
  (jenkins repo) -> Settings -> Webhooks -> Add webhook.

* Payload URL = <Public-IP>:8080/github-webhook/
* Content type = application/json
* Secret = Jenkins Admin password
* Which events would youn like to trigger this webhook? = Just push event.
* Select -> Active
* Click on -> Create webhook
* Check under thr Recent Deliveries to see if the webhook has been able to be pinged from Github.

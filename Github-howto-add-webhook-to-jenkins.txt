Pre-reqs
--------

Since Github needs to be able to access the Jenkins Master, which in my case runs on my laptop. 

1) The router (home) must be able to allow access via port forwarding to port 8080 on the public IP

Steps
-----

Create the webhook in the Github's repository you want to Genkins to run automatically upon a push (defult) is executed. 

https://github.com/hernando-garcia/jenkins
(jenkins repo) -> Settings -> Webhooks -> Add webhook.

Payload URL = <Public-IP>:8080/github-webhook/
Content type = application/json
Secret = Jenkins Admin password
Which events would youn like to trigger this webhook? = Just push event.
Select -> Active
Click on -> Create webhook
Check under thr Recent Deliveries to see if the webhook has been able to be pinged from Github.
